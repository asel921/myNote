Remote Shortname

The output of $git remote is just the word 'origin'. The word 'origin', here is
referred to as a 'shortname'. A shortname is just a short and easy way
to refer to the locatin of the remote repository. A shortname is local 
to the 'current' repository (as in, you local repository). The word 'origin'
is the defacto name that's used to refer to the amin remote repository.
It's possible to rename this to something else, but typically it's left as 'origin'

A pull request is a request to the original or source repository's maintainer to include changes in their
project that you made in your fork of their project. You are requesting that they pull in changes you've made.
